They are happy.
Tom died yesterday.
How do I get to Park Street?
Tell Tom he has to wash the dishes.
Why can't you come?
I'll give you this camera.
You are really talented.
I remember mailing the letter.
Now let's begin the game.
I didn't hear what you said.
Hello!
You're not ready yet.
You don't necessarily have to go to the airport to reconfirm your plane reservation.
These shoes are hers.
That wasn't my intention.
She speaks relatively quickly.
I am from Russia.
"Frankly speaking, he is wrong."
We have breakfast in the kitchen.
She's way taller than me.
Is he American?
He feels a lot better today.
What's your favorite music?
Check this.
He took his sister along.
This book is unique in many ways.
They checked how pure the water was.
I prefer biking.
You arrived too early.
She likes blue dresses.
Stress can have an enormous negative impact on your health.
I missed you guys so much!
"I was going to write to you, but I forgot."
His victory made him a hero.
The curtain has not yet risen.
You'd better not swim if you've just eaten.
He is at his office.
Tom told me he wanted me to learn how to do that.
I don't pretend to understand women.
I know only this.
He fooled her.
You need to study harder.
What did you do for a living?
China is a huge country.
I'll pay the bill.
Let's make a trade.
Is she Japanese?
Be friendly.
"We need action, not words."
Tom is on the phone with Mary.
I feed my cat every morning and every evening.
I love reading books.
I'll never forget our first date.
Do you travel a lot?
He turned down my application.
I'm lucky.
I haven't been completely honest with you.
I felt my phone vibrating in my pocket.
He is one of the greatest artists in Japan.
He's not stupid.
This is an extremely important point.
Tom hates going to school.
None of my friends drink coffee.
My mother is making a cake for my father.
What do you see in him?
We're in mourning.
You'd better go.
I think it's time for a drink.
We're not involved.
Add a little milk.
I lost my job.
I can't understand what you're saying.
"You can swim, can't you?"
Let's finish the job.
Are you in a hurry?
This park is really beautiful and clean.
You're wrong in this case.
Could I get a little piece of that cake?
Thank you for the pleasant evening.
We have to do something about what's going on.
"Hey, wait a minute. Where do you think you're going?"
A good idea occurred to me.
Why did you tell Tom it was my fault?
I want to go to America someday.
Is this your first visit to this town?
It may rain soon.
I am able to drive a car.
What made you so angry?
I've tried to warn you.
We're at home.
You're on your own now.
Can you help me with my work?
What you're suggesting is stupid.
I forgot to give you what Tom gave me to give you.
You'd better not wait here.
We have eaten there three times.
Please close the door.
Snails move slowly.
May I go to the movies tonight?
I have to find it.
Do you think fish can hear?
She has beautiful handwriting.
All of my friends like soccer.
You talk too much.
She appears to have a headache.
I'm not the problem.
Respect yourself and you will be respected.
I suggested to Tom the possibility that he work with Mary.
I read his book.
We haven't seen a lot tourists around here lately.
It appears to me that you are all mistaken.
Would you like to watch TV?
It's fall now.
Can I wait for Tom here?
Is this a river?
Aren't you in love with me anymore?
I am not acquainted with him.
Where is Tom's classroom?
He works in the car industry.
Nobody cares for me.
Can I speak to the person in charge?
My father works in a factory.
It makes no difference to me whether he joins us or not.
God helps those who help themselves.
Where are my glasses?
Do you see that?
"At last, I graduated from junior high school."
We're going to keep doing this until someone tells us that we can't.
What do you like?
I don't think that's correct.
It wasn't the first time.
This is a dangerous thing.
There is a rumor that the radicals are plotting against the government.
Who owns this villa?
I've waited for three days.
How many boys are there in this class?
"Fasten your seat belt, please."
Do you think he made that mistake on purpose?
I got on the wrong bus.
What are you watching?
I'm at a loss for words.
I'm trying to help you.
Let me go.
Tom married a local girl.
I'm sad.
You can go home now.
Go to church with your parents and pray for her.
It's up to you.
This wall is painted green.
I hope that you won't make the same mistake as Tom.
He overslept this morning.
His mother was ashamed of him.
You can't all come in.
It was very nice seeing you again.
This desk takes up too much room.
We're hot.
These are our books.
I'm afraid Tom doesn't want to talk to you.
I'm a boy.
I can help Tom out.
Do you still need tea?
I appreciate all you did.
One can always find time.
He paid no attention to what she said.
"Well, stranger things have happened."
This word is also French in origin.
Not many students attended the meeting.
We can open the window.
Can you swim as fast as he can?
I love the sound of rain on the roof.
Tom wrote a story about that.
It's too big.
It is clear that he has made a big mistake.
Tom's a bit freaked out.
She looks as if she were drunk.
The decision is not final.
Yes. That's right.
This house is mine.
He was poor and couldn't buy a coat.
You must perform your duty.
It's not going to be that easy.
My husband is a very good cook.
Tom is wearing a sports coat.
Are you all right now?
I'm very sensitive to cold. May I have another blanket?
This car is like new.
Good morning. It's time to wake up.
Do you know what time it is in Boston?
Where's my book?
He always wears blue shirts.
When did you graduate from college?
I'll meet you outside.
I just don't want you to do something you'll be sorry for.
Listen up.
I learned to play guitar when I was ten years old.
Tom's not home.
I'm reading a book about animals.
"You are tired, aren't you?"
Did he learn Japanese as well?
We need to communicate with each other.
Paris is the capital of France.
The brake didn't work.
School begins the day after tomorrow.
Run!
You're joking!
They became man and wife.
He seems to have been rich.
I'm really hungry.
Still waters run deep.
Delivery of goods occurs a month after the order is placed.
You understand me.
Parents love their children.
"You're a philosopher, aren't you?"
You'd better hurry up if you want to get home before dark.
A collection of her verses has just been published.
"Because he's sick, he can't come."
Mary had a tiff with her boyfriend.
Be discreet.
She is used to staying up late.
We received word of his death.
Get back to work.
The converse is also true.
Tom is a nice man.
I liked the room overlooking the valley.
Where's your school?
But Dad won't like it.
This happened for a reason.
I got what she was saying.
They demanded damages from the driver.
Do you like it?
School begins at 8:30 a.m.
Was her story true?
My mother can't ride a bicycle.
Americans have lost their trust in Toyota.
I don't know whether she will come.
Don't leave me alone.
Tom can't decide whether he should go.
These fireworks are spectacular!
I don't even know what that is.
The dragon is an imaginary creature.
You're wasting water.
Wood burns.
Go back to your seat.
You can always come here.
It was a very big room.
You must fulfill your duty.
War is a terrible thing.
Tom isn't the right man for the job.
Each country has its own customs.
Stay away from me.
I saw a man coming toward me.
We're going to Boston to see Tom.
I've never seen a car this old in such good condition.
I guarantee that this information is correct.
How's Tom?
I need to talk to you about an urgent matter.
Tom is always talking.
How fascinating!
Tom can't buy what he needs because he doesn't have enough money.
"Whenever they meet, they quarrel."
He catches colds easily.
You should sleep.
I have to go now.
He doesn't have any idea how important this meeting is.
She is almost as tall as you.
My arm still hurts.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Can you drive a car?
This project will take at least a year to finish.
I wonder why Tom said that.
Cut the potatoes.

My sister and I went to the castle.
I want to die.
Why won't you be here tomorrow?

Do I have to do it right away?
Aren't you going to tell Tom?

Tom lived with us for three months.
We're coming.
All you have to do is read these two pages.
What time are you coming back?
You can take the bus to the station.
I saw your father.
A fork fell off the table.
That house belongs to him.
"One way or another, we'll find Tom."
Will you please let me go now?
There was a car accident yesterday.
Don't worry. I'll stay with you.
Spring will come soon.
He was not invited.
I don't want to watch that movie.
Let's consider the worst that could happen.
Is this your book?
Let's play cards.
I think he's happy.
I have something that I want to say to you.
How can you say that?
It's hot today.

He let us go.
I think I'm in love.
Let me handle this.
My clock needs to be fixed.
It's as old as the hills.
Tom and Mary don't live in the same state.
You aren't responsible for that mess.

That's good news.

I advise you not to keep company with Tom.
He likes oranges.
You are in my way.
I owe Tom an apology.
The car crashed into the wall.
Can you tell me the way to the library?
Stop yelling!

You always try to blame somebody else.
My car burns a lot of gas.
This book is about a king who loses his crown.
No one came except Mary.
Are all the passengers aboard?
"The road is icy, so take care."
What are you thinking about?
That castle is beautiful.
She's very innocent.
I don't want to look like a tourist.
Her garden is a work of art.
"He is poor, but happy."
My uncle came to see me.
You are always late.
I would like to ask a question.
We make milk into cheese and butter.
I made him open the door.
I didn't want to look stupid.
I am a student of this school.
Tom is wanted for murder.
She was arrested by the police.
We should sit down.
She will be seventeen next year.
Are you looking for someone?
This is not my car.
"Had I arrived earlier, I could have seen Kelly."
It is costly and politically difficult to continue this conflict.
Do you remember your passport number?
You never should've let Tom go to Boston with Mary.
That car is very new.
No problem at all!
Does Tom know about it?
Is that clear?
I'm not leaving until you tell me what I want to know.
I didn't study at all yesterday.
You may come if you like.
Follow him.
There are a lot of students in the gym.
This surprised many people.
She must be angry with me.
You can ask him for help.
Look carefully. I'm going to show you how it's done.
"You hate tourists, don't you?"
I can't see anything.
I'm not sure if I like this one or that one.
I'll never betray you.
I wish I could forget about that incident.
That red sweater looks good on you.
Ladies first.
I don't know this neighborhood too well.
Is this your first visit to Japan?
"I heard a cotton candy shop has just opened. Let's go, dudes."
May I come in?
"In the summer, the temperature ranges from thirty to forty degrees Celsius."
He lost all of his money.
Which is your book?

Put your weapons down.
"Don't worry, I'll translate that for you."
I still can't believe we won.
I don't like movies.
I asked him not to drive so fast.
What did you do with those books?

Give me another chance.
We have two ears.
Tom's clothes are out of fashion.
The car broke down.
I often forget to brush my teeth.

This is the case.
I know her.
Do as I say.
I have a brother.
Which way is the beach?

Could you tell me how to use this washing machine?
That's a relief.
Leave the rest to me.

Were you with anyone?

I'm old enough to make my own decisions.
Why is he here?
Tom isn't happy.
Tom survived.
I really wasn't expecting that from you.
Isn't there something you want to say to me?
I am at home.
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
Aren't you Tom's mother?
I said that.
Tom and Mary enjoyed themselves at the party.
You must judge for yourself.
"When I last saw him, he was wearing a blue shirt and white slacks."
There's a hotel across the street.
Tom threw Mary out of the bar.
I'm looking forward to your Halloween party.
No one suspected a thing.
"Because he lied, he was punished."
"I'm just looking, thank you."

I'm not sure what I'm looking at.
Who are those people?
There are no hospitals in the vicinity of his house.
I'm not going unless Tom goes.
I'm just like you.
You may take either the big box or the small one.
"You can't swim, can you?"
Why not go to the movies?
Please visit me tomorrow.
I'll be waiting inside.
Forget it!
I've lost all respect for you.
How old are you?
She accused me of telling a lie.
What is the difference between this and that?
It's the right decision.
We don't have to do this every day.
Give me the book.
I don't need your help.
Please help yourself.
I would like to speak to the head nurse.

Maybe she won't come.
What are you reading?
Do you wash your hands before meals?
We have to start somewhere.

Knowledge is power.
You can't do two things at once.

The man caught the girl by the wrist.
Why didn't you say yes?
Get out!
The area was quiet.
"I'm sorry, but I can't hear you well."
How far is it from here to the museum?
I don't know when he'll be here.
I hope you don't forget to do that.
I'm really glad to hear that.
I woke up at five this morning.
Your English is improving.
Let's not go home.

You are not our friend.
"Hurry up, or you'll miss your plane."
Please tell me how I can get in touch with him.
Tom is now studying in the library.
This play has ended.
She's a quiet person.
"Great, isn't it?"
Many businesses closed down.
A woman without a man is nothing.
"He went to the store at the last minute, just before it closed."
It's Monday.
I hope that it rains tomorrow.
Tom tried not to look disappointed.
Tom won't likely be able to cope with the situation.
They kept it secret that they were in love.
"Tom, what are you doing?"
My family is not very large.
We'll just follow you.

I think they saw me.
My cousins are coming in a few days.
We talked about a lot of things.

I don't consider Tom a friend.
I like this city very much.
Goodnight.
I love my dad.
Your pencils need sharpening.
There has been no rain here for the past two weeks.

Your friend is here.
Please forgive me for not having written sooner.
This is a joke.
Tom seemed bored.
Do it yourself and do it right away.

I have a lot of dreams.
A lot of people do that.

I am only joking.
Would you like to listen?
Who's that boy?
This bird cannot fly.
Can I have your full name?
The lecture lasted for two hours.

That's why we're here.
My aunt gave me a book for Christmas.
She told me she knew my brother.
I'd like to introduce some friends of mine.
Tom looks amazing.
She filled the glass with wine.
Cut the cake with a knife.
Of course.
I'm sure that Tom will do that.
Did you catch the train?
"If her temperature goes up, send for the doctor."
The wedding will take place next spring.
Did you pay for the book?
I'm new here.
He read the document aloud.
I have three cousins on my mother's side.
You've earned it.
I don't know if I have the time.
How pretty you look today!
It was very hot this afternoon.
You're very perceptive.
I chose to look the other way.
I'm sure Tom appreciates everything you've done for him.
I believe you want to help.
I saw her enter the room.
Why do you think I'm scared of you?
She began to talk to the dog.
Don't forget that you need to buy some onions.
I'm not thirsty.
"May I see your driver's license, sir?"
Let's watch TV.
We were all present at her wedding.
Will you go with Tom?
Let's make a trade.
Is there anything that you want to tell me?
Answer the question.
Birds fly.
"The tea at my office isn't good, so I don't drink it."
Tom is waiting for a reply.
She tore the letter into pieces.
How many people did you see in the park?
You were busy last week.
How could you not say something?
Too much stress can lead to physical disease.

We don't have enough money to buy everything we need.

I really didn't mean to hurt you.
So far everything has been successful.
Japan is in the eastern part of Asia.
Clean your room.
The old man spoke to me in French.
There are twelve months in a year.
I do not like science.
What do you think is the best way to get to Tom's house from here?
That doesn't seem right at all.
I used to be forgetful.
Tom finally stopped laughing.
"Yeah. I think so, too."
"Their punishment was harsh, but just."
I wish I could go to the concert.
May I stay here tonight?
She advised him not to eat too much.

He lent me two books.
Do you really love me?
You must keep your promise.
I'm not a problem-solver.
Tom doesn't trust Mary anymore.
I will wait for you in front of the school.
She has hundreds of books.
A prolonged silence followed.
That's what happened here on Monday.
He wanted to succeed.
Aren't you Tom?
Thanks a bunch.
There are many islands in Greece.
I'll visit a museum today.
The climate here is mild.
There's only a little milk left.
Everybody likes her.
I need your advice.
He couldn't run very fast.
Tom lives in a poor neighborhood.
"In Japan, it rains quite a bit during our rainy season which is from mid-June until mid-July."
Tom invited Mary to supper.
How could anyone forget it?
I make €100 a day.
Why wouldn't we do that?
Tom isn't a good singer.
I made him open the door.
The smell of food made me hungry.
Our living room is sunny.
We didn't see her anywhere.
Do you think it's going to snow?
I'll see you later.
He always tells the truth.
Happy New Year!
I can't live that kind of life.

Whose shoes are these?
Tom is going to come live with us.
We're just going to talk.
I like tennis.
What is that huge building?
How much for half a kilo?

He went up Mt. Fuji.
Playing tennis is fun.
I'm a baker.
Lack of food had left him weak and exhausted.
Do you have one?
"You don't smoke, do you?"
Nothing great has been achieved by playing it safe.
"You bought the food, so if I buy the wine that will even things up."
Tom only drinks water.
Maybe Tom knows something.
Translate this book into English.
Pardon me?
"Lend me your book, please."
The wounded woman was a Brazilian tourist.
What are your conditions?

This tie doesn't go with my suit.
Have you done your homework?
Do you know how to use a dictionary?
I don't remember what happened anymore.
How interesting!
Do you have a receipt?
Who won?
He tried to pull a fast one on me.
I've lost my ticket.
Tom still isn't here.
See you tomorrow at the library.
I think I can run as fast as Tom.

You look tired.
Tom never gives up.
My father loves pizza.
May I share this table with you?
She went to Italy to study music.

He only paid ten dollars for that shirt.
You've got to go.
Be supportive.
They come from Sweden.
Terrific!

Do you like music?
We lost the game.
They eat with a knife and fork.
Take off your shoes.
He was wounded in the shoulder.
Do you really want me to do that?
You shouldn't judge a person by his appearance.
His car ran into a tree.
I don't want to tell them why I'm late.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
Tom didn't know how many of them needed help.
Please take me to the hospital.
It's raining again!
I have to go to the bank today.
He can drive a car.
We'll do it tomorrow.
This idea is not rational.

I saw you driving your new car.
My brother is an idiot.
This doll is a gift from my aunt.
Can I bring someone?
He disappeared without a trace.
He is not stupid.
This boat is seaworthy.
Listen carefully.
He makes it a rule to take a walk every morning.
That's a good idea!
"Take off your socks, please."
Tom is coming for you.
I was watching TV then.
Keep your home warm.
Is this your first visit?
I aimed my gun at the target.
I'm not a tourist.
I have some pictures to show you.
I'm your partner.
I can come tomorrow.
I'm trying to sleep.
He continued reading the book.
We've prepared well.
I'm broke.
I'll call you later.
It's not at all impossible.
It's a small world.
I slept only two hours.
Tom understands.
She refused his offer.
I met her in a coffee shop near the station.
"What's important is not the goal, but the journey."
Is that your mom?
What did I forget to say?
I hear the drum.
I don't want to work.
He drew a straight line on the wall.
She finished reading the letter.
Seriously?
It was about twenty dollars.
Take a look at that.
She is about to leave.
Be prepared.
"Wait a minute, Tom!"
I'm thirsty.
Do you believe that?
Let's just pretend like we don't know each other.
None of my classmates live near here.
Just put it anywhere.
His son was expelled from school.
Tom doesn't actually live within Boston city limits.
I don't know where I should look.
I wish to be a doctor.

I am going to be a doctor.
Is this a picture that you yourself drew?
What do you like?
I don't believe it!
This is Tom's favorite book.
I'll be watching you.
I really like this car.
A broken-down car was standing in the middle of the road.
It's too small.
Study hard so you don't fail.
They reached their goal.

I will go to America tomorrow.
I got it.
Where're you going?
I want to try this.
He lost his father at sea.
Do you like tennis?
Tom scored a goal.
I really wish to see you today.
What's your impression of the United States?
I worked hard in order to support my family.
I'm sure you're mistaken.
I need to get a stamp.
I still miss Tom.
That color doesn't look good on me.
"You know I'm not coming back, don't you?"
How long do you think Tom can hold his breath?
You have a way with women.
Return this book as soon as you can.
Let's get ready to go.
The bus leaves in five minutes.
Tom calculated his expenses.
I think I understand.
I can't find my pen.
I took your advice.
What do you think is the best way to get to Tom's house from here?
Leave me alone.
Thank you for the pleasant evening.
Go on.
How much money do you have?
I'll get my bag.
I thought you said Tom was dead.
You may not come in.
What time will you leave?
That's enough.
Tom pretended to be angry.
"You know why I don't have to do that, don't you?"
Thank you for your interest.
Tom can't stay for long so let's get the meeting started.
Who said that?
How did you make this soup?
You have a bright future.
He and I walked together.
I need to get a stamp.
I have a book.
He is talking on the phone.
He will always be with you.
This doesn't concern me.

You have to go.
That's hard to say.
Tom is willing to stand by you.
She has a few friends.
Put the book where you found it.
I congratulated him on his success.
I never for a moment imagined that I would win.
Look out!
He has a lot of money.
There has been an accident at the worksite.
There is nothing to be proud of.
What do you see in the picture?
Do what Tom tells you to do.
Why don't people say what they mean?
Who is it?
Where is your school?
"How old are you? ""I'm 16 years old."""
Take off your shoes.
Did you play tennis?
Let's wait and see if that happens.
Not all Muslims are Arabs.
Tom liked Mary's new hairstyle.

It's good talking to you.
Have any letters arrived for me?
Please think about it.
You're a good boy.
You're looking down.
Feel free to get yourself a drink if you are thirsty.
Tom tried his hardest to persuade Mary.
Congratulations!
The meat smells terrible.
I wasn't impressed by what Tom did.
"A glass of water, please."
I'm going to take you where you'll be safe.
"You don't know what you are doing, do you?"
My house is big.
Love is blind.
Do you have anything to say regarding this?

They're not here yet.
I can't remember the tune of that song.
There were no roses in the garden.
A man touched down on the moon. A wall came down in Berlin. A world was connected by our own science and imagination.
I've never climbed Mt. Fuji.
They let me go.
We ran in the park.
Tom got here before sunrise.
It's hard to forget what happened.
I hope your brother is better.
We played soccer yesterday.
We went out in spite of the rain.
No one could deny this.
That doesn't change anything.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
The police arrested the man who had murdered the girl.
I'm going to stay home tonight.
Tom said he was really glad he did that.
"Without air, nothing could live."
I don't believe you. You're always lying.
Don't give up yet. I'm sure you can do it.
You deserve the prize.
I'll call the cops.
Be prepared.
He loves traveling.
She used to visit me regularly.
It'll only take a minute of your time.
Have you ever gone skinny dipping?
Don't worry about such a thing.
Can you call me a taxi?
Please turn over.
I once wanted to be an astrophysicist.
The population of this city is decreasing every year.
You'd better take an umbrella with you.
Bring backup.
That's because you're a girl.
You had a choice.
Please clean the floor with this mop.
All Tom really needed was a hug.
Where are we going?
Who invented the telephone?
I'll call you back later.
The hotel was burned down.
What plans do you have for Sunday?
I like chocolate.
You should begin right away.
They know Tom.
Her questions indicate that she understands the subject very well.
It's too good to be true.
I don't know what to do anymore.
She hopes to become a designer.
I exhausted myself by walking a long distance.
I have no words to express my gratitude.
These are my pencils.
I usually do the dishes.
What are you cooking?
Do you know who invented the microscope?
We are Arabs.
Tom told me he thought Mary wanted to do that.
Hurry up.
You were busy.
The hospital is crowded.
Don't take chances.
Your friendship means a lot to me.
Tom wants to meet me.
I admire you for your courage.
He loves rituals.
It turned out that I was right.
He speaks four languages.
What if I'm right?
The bridge was built by the Romans.
Please tell her to call me back.
Control yourselves.
The first issue that we have to confront is violent extremism in all of its forms.
I want to be a doctor.
There's a book here.
I studied English when I was there.
What's the purpose of your trip?
Tom took the wrong bus.
I'm alone.
"Where are the toilets, please?"
I'm going to the bank.
When I saw his new hairstyle I tried hard to suppress my laughter.
Bring it back to me.
Will you go to the party tonight?
I'm in love with you and I want to marry you.
Were you at school at that time?
He was dressed in blue.
Who's there?
Tom is a fluent speaker of Japanese.
He was laid off.
This is my page on Facebook.
It was worth a try.
She didn't give me my money back.
I would like to speak to the head nurse.
I'm afraid of bats.
They fell one after another.
We can't stay for dinner.
It's too hot.
I turned right.
What're you saying?
How did you sleep last night?
You should quit smoking.
Have faith.
Let's go see if Tom can help us.
She asked me to open the window.
Deal us the cards.
Let's discuss that problem later.
Mary spoke Japanese slowly.
Where is the mistake?
We are going downtown to eat pizza.
It was at school.
I'm at home.
I've shut all six windows.
"Democracy is the worst form of government, except all the others that have been tried."
I write poems in my free time.
We are all convinced of his innocence.
You look gloomy.
What did you do last vacation?
He was brave.
What kind of fruit do you want?
He took a picture of the koala.
I have no homework today.
You must follow school rules.
I smell something rotten.
Good morning.
The plane crashed into the house.
This car is his.
You can always sleep on my couch.
Taking care of the baby is my job.
Can your mother drive a car?
I think it's OK.
I must hide.
Everyone is free to contribute.
I went to the coffee shop yesterday.
The rumor spread throughout the country.
I do not think that he will come.
Why didn't you just say that before?
I didn't like it.
The cat slowly approached the mouse.
We need your help.
I'm giving up smoking.
He was silent all the time.
I hate chemistry.
I didn't have to do anything.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The king governed the country.
Look out!
"I'm sorry, but it's no longer available."
That's certainly one possibility.
It's going to be difficult for us to do that.
I assume the two of you know each other.
I am constantly forgetting names.
Tom got into a fight with Mary's brother and got his nose broken.
"If you want to hear a scary story, I'll tell you about a dream I had a few weeks ago."
Tom left.
Everyone was happy.
I studied for one hour.
Open your mouth!
I use Firefox.
I'd rather not go out today.
My daughter is getting married in June.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
Whose pen is this?
Are you happy?
Tom didn't know how to express his thanks in French.
The sea is rough.
I want to read as many English books as possible this year.
I want to go to Tokyo.
What would you say if you were in my place?
Are you planning to help them?
The train leaves in ten minutes.
"Well, let's get going!"
I think you're right.
He jumped out the window.
It was well worth the trouble.
Did you enjoy the movies?
She became a doctor.
I'm just looking.
Talk to me!
I don't know what I'll do.
Let's talk about somebody else.
I think you are a really nice person.
I'm finding it difficult deciding on which one to buy.
"Last night, he studied all night long."
I decided to tell her that I love her.
You don't need to work today.
I don't know.
They don't eat meat.
I called my friend after arriving at the station.
We still have to do that.
Tom knows that.
Everybody knows that.
The bug is still alive.
That's great!
It will probably snow tomorrow.
That house belongs to him.
What's that bird called?
There is no use in crying. No one will hear you.
I'm just glad Tom wasn't hurt.
He's taller than me.
It looks like this car is his.
Did Tom die?
My conscience is clear.
I'm here as a tourist.
I'm not in the best of shape.
May I sit here?
"You'll be busy tomorrow, won't you?"
The hunter followed the bear's tracks.
Two detectives followed the suspect.
She is very clever.
Is this information right?
"When I want to cry, I think of you."
I'm tired.
Both of them are in the room.
It is impossible to live without water.
"Sit down, please, he said."
This is an extremely important point.
May I help you?
Those dogs are big.
Don't you want to watch TV?
God never forgets even a small kindness.
Don't mention this to anyone.
"Although I didn't like math, I had to study logarithms."
The earth is round.
How rude of you!
I asked him to send us the book.
He can do it.
I wouldn't swim in this lake.
He told me not to drive too fast.
"She didn't have any money, so she couldn't go with me."
I'm listening to music.
He is an ace pitcher.
Are you sure?
Help me.
You'll forget about me someday.
He looked up at the sky.
Who stole the apple?
How many books did you read?
I'm a bit hungry.
How will we pay our debts now?
I can't forget about that stupid movie.
Let's go someplace else.
It seems right to me.
I came to Japan last year.
I'm poor.
His illness may be cancer.
Why did you leave your job?
Prices are high these days.
Come on. Let's get out of here.
"Hi, come on in."
It looks like this house is a total mess.
It's so dark.
Your bath is ready.
Are you asking me to marry you?
Let's speak in English.
Books are my best friends.
When did the accident happen?
How do you know that?
I got tired of lying in bed all day.
I treated her as my own daughter.
I can hardly hear you.
See you tomorrow at the library.
What did you do with that camera?
He looks young.
I want you to read it.
It's gotten better.
I'd like to make an appointment for fluoride treatments for my son.
"If you don't hurry, you'll miss the train."
Let's get started right away.
Here is my bicycle.
Do you ever dream about flying through the sky?
Let's go see if Tom can help us.
"Thank you. ""You're welcome."""
I see Tom.
What happened last night?
That's not what I wanted to tell you.
"Sit down, please."
I was in shock.
How embarrassing!
I think he won't come.
Did I miss anything?
He is capable of teaching French.
Those books are theirs.
I like it.
This is how we cook rice.
I'm very happy.
What are you suggesting we do?
Where are you off to?
He is a fast speaker.
Check again.
Don't look for me.
My father has never been abroad.
Don't say that.
Tom found that he couldn't study with the TV on.
The boy remained silent.
I forgot.
I caused this.
"Answer the telephone, will you?"
"Speak louder, please."
You're such a good friend.
Someone is at the front door.
That was not my intention.
I have no sisters.
Do you really want me to go there right now?
Why are we hiding?
You must follow the rules.
Is that a cat or a dog?
"Which one do you prefer, the red one or the blue one?"
My father's a doctor.
Tom says that he enjoyed the concert.
You are my mother.
Tom swam across the river.
Do you like San Francisco?
There wasn't anyone there.
Why is she doing this?
She does nothing but complain.
English is not my mother tongue.
I met her an hour ago.
The guard was on duty all night.
That is why he got angry.
The park is filled with children.
He rested his hand on my shoulder.
I don't worry so much about my resume.
We are teachers.
Has anybody seen Tom?
I don't want to go shopping by myself.
Why is Boston such a popular destination for tourists?
I'm going there even if you don't go.
What's this?
My mother made me a cute skirt.
I've seen that.
Do you own a computer?
There are many tourists in town.
How long does it take to get to the station?
Do you want to be rich?
Is that milk still good?
What is it that you want?
I saw her clean the room.
Her son called from New York.
The girl screamed when she saw the flames.
"If you don't leave us alone, I'm calling the police."
I just wish I knew how to speak French.
Are you a senior high school student?
She wrote a book about birds.
Be respectful.
It's gotten better.
She has a few books.
Tom hates shopping.
You may go anywhere.
Nobody understands me.
I love reading books.
Is there a cash machine near here?
This knife was very useful to me.
I can play tennis.
Squirrels move quickly.
Earth is a beautiful planet.
Your answer differs from mine.
This is never going to end.
Tell me what the matter is.
Why does Tom worry so much?
Is she a doctor?
Let's go see if Tom can help us.
Tell Tom who you met today.
This dictionary is superior to that one.
Where does she work?
"Generally speaking, history repeats itself."
I know where you are.
Is that car yours?
Most people think I'm crazy.
Look at me.
"Write your address, please."
Do you promise?
"By the way, have you ever been to Hokkaido?"
They had only one child.
He decided to go abroad.
Could you help me find Tom?
Cancer can be cured if discovered in time.
They are happy.
That team has strong players.
I don't pretend to understand women.
She must still be in her twenties.
Who ate the bread?
"Thank you very much, doctor."
Tom is tall and strong.
Forget what I said yesterday.
"Apparently, the bus is late."
I think she is very attractive.
"Tom always wears a tie to work, except on Fridays."
This reminds me of you.
Tom has the ability to do that.
Darwin changed the way we see the world.
Tom has kids.
Will you take your hand off me?
He was covered with mud from head to foot.
I would like to ask a question.
You will miss the train.
Am I clear?
I've spoken to your teachers.
Bread is made from wheat.
I'm feeling fit.
I followed her into the room.
Why is Tom being so nice to us?
He drives his own car.
Should we go by car or by taxi?
We are hungry.
Tom seems OK now.
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone.
I'll never forgive you.
This is really interesting.
That wasn't nice.
What happened here?
Tom likes cheeseburgers.
Is your wife a good cook?
Get out of bed!
They shared the money.
Hope is not a strategy.
"Excuse me, I'm lost."
Someone is watching you.
Everything is fine.
My mother made me a new dress.
There is nothing like a glass of beer after a whole day's work.
Tom refused to talk about it.
What? I can't hear you guys.
Most students come to school on foot.
"I understand, but I cannot agree."
A considerable number of students want to go to college.
Most people think computers will never be able to think.
The door's locked.
The doctor examined the patients.
We went to the zoo.
Please write down what I am going to say.
All my siblings are taller than me.
Tom walks slowly.
Tom felt something crawling on his arm.
They've already eaten.
The boy started crying.
It's too hot.
My dream has come true.
The box is almost empty.
Is there life on Mars?
I think Tom is likely to like this movie.
"Seeing the policeman, the man ran away."
Don't look back.
Have you forgotten about me?
Let me sleep for another ten minutes.
I have a pen.
The well ran dry.
In Japan a new school year starts in April.
Maybe she will not come.
The jet landed at Tokyo.
Don't stop him.
Do you like to travel by yourself?
Tom can't understand why Mary is angry.
Where are you from?
Can I talk to you a moment?
This is true.
The doctor advised that she take a holiday.
Tom and Mary are getting ready.
You ought to thank him.
He was very thirsty and asked for some water.
Tom will leave the company at the end of the year.
My briefcase is full of papers.
Are you going anywhere?
I can jump.
The water was cold.
Were you tired last night?
Go back to your seats.
I had a bad dream last night.
Can I take a break now?
Let's forget last night ever happened.
A drowning man will clutch at a straw.
I know those girls.
I was born in Kyoto in 1980.
Tom was working for me.
Can I use my credit card?
Let me know if you hear anything.
I want to tell you what happened.
He is a genius.
"I may have met him somewhere before, but I can't recall where."
Where are my keys?
I don't think he's coming.
You don't have to study.
There are many shrines in Kyoto.
Even Homer sometimes nods.
I can't believe it!
I don't use Facebook.
You're running late.
Few people know about the plan.
Have you answered that letter yet?
I'll buy this.
My father contracted pneumonia last month.
Stand up!
Can I help you?
When are you going to do that?
Tom hid under the table.
Where's the money?
Do you have a pen?
"The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941."
Can't you do anything to help me?
We are teachers.
What'll you be doing over the weekend?
Do you have any Japanese magazines?
I owe my success to their help.
Flowers bloom.
Let's get drunk.
Let's get out of here before Tom sees us.
What's wrong?
Write your name in full.
I said I would make her happy.
I like playing tennis and golf.
This watch is broken.
My brother uses this bike.
One of my dreams is to learn Icelandic.
Their trip was postponed because of the rain.
We're going to have a test today.
He asked us to help him.
I have many friends.
It wasn't very hot last night.
That factory makes toys.
Of course!
She wept bitterly.
Please think about it.
I had a strange dream last night.
What season do you like the best?
If you're not with us then you're against us.
No one believed me at first.
Do you know who he is?
This is my home.
I have one sister.
She wore a red dress.
Come forward.
Why did you buy this car?
I remember hearing that music somewhere.
Artificial light is produced by electricity.
I swim once a week.
The teacher approved his plan.
They are watching what's happening closely.
What is going on here?
Put the gun on the table.
Get out!
How tall you are!
How you've grown!
I haven't finished my homework yet.
It's a secret.
I have no time to do my homework.
Please give me a pencil and some sheets of paper.
We immediately became friends.
Please leave me alone.
I'm 19.
She turned around and smiled.
He got the ball.
"You're Tom's friend, aren't you?"
It's not a perfect system.
Tell me your impression of this book.
Do it right away.
I don't know where my ski gloves are.
Please be serious.
That music always reminded me of you.
That's not what I wanted to show you.
What makes you so sure Tom was the one who stole your bicycle?
I showered before breakfast.
That's my book.
I'd like to report a theft.
I'm going through changes.
Tom got very mad.
How long does it take?
He tried to get rid of the ants.
This matter does not concern me.
I have two sons.
We were all tired.
You should have refused his offer.
He does speak well.
You may be right.
School begins at 8:30 a.m.
Are there any English magazines in this library?
Where did you get this?
Are you really a princess?
"You never change, do you?"
She may not come here tomorrow.
She is happy.
"Did she buy a watch? ""Yes, she did."""
Stay here with us.
The war finally broke out.
Stop hitting your brother.
I'm ready to leave now.
You can come with me.
This is Mary's dog.
I met an old man near the station.
I won't answer questions.
You can come with us.
Tom's died.
Where did you buy that dress?
Please shut the door behind you.
I'm going to miss Boston.
She's way taller than me.
They aren't like us.
I saw Tom dancing with another girl.
No one knew who did it.
I'm a translator.
I eat a lot of rice.
Come on. Let's go home.
I've been here for a week.
Tom will never do that.
I took a walk.
Stop wasting water.
My father goes to work by bike.
Our plane was flying above the clouds.
The only thing constant in this world is change.
I watched TV this morning.
The best hairdressers are gay.
The house is haunted.
Do I look like I'm kidding?
I don't like talking with strangers.
She traveled all over the world.
I forget his name.
Please step back.
My father lives in the country.
This is the only alternative.
There's so much I want to say to you.
"Sensing danger, he ran away."
I can't stand him.
Stay here with us.
I'm in love with you and I want to marry you.
Let him go!
A dolphin is a kind of mammal.
"Why is autumn called ""fall"" in America?"
Can I help you?
Tom is out there.
She is accustomed to sitting.
Why didn't you believe me?
Can you speak French?
Tom got these tickets for free.
Please turn the page.
She has a daughter who is a pianist.
Stop it right now!
Who's that girl?
That's what makes me happy.
Children don't need their own rooms.
Actions speak louder than words.
Country life is very peaceful in comparison with city life.
I work every day except for Sundays.
That was years ago.
Pus has formed in the wound.
Let's take a trip to Australia.
We're happy.
What did you make?
Tom is the only one who can do this.
Don't tell anyone.
Do you like French?
She lost her way.
You ticked them off.
Tom and Mary met in 2013.
Tom didn't have any reason not to believe Mary.
"From the direction that he was going in, I would say he was headed to town."
We returned to Boston on October 20th.
He doesn't like coffee.
Was Tom the one who gave you this squirt gun?
He did exactly what I told him to do.
What are you frightened of?
We're facing a violent crisis.
Do you think Tom will come?
I've always trusted Tom.
I'm beginning to feel cold.
I read your book.
Few people know about the plan.
What did you put into the boxes?
She spoke to me in Spanish.
He will arrive in Paris tomorrow.
I was wrong.
Why did you choose me?
Please help me cook.
Tom is happy.
What a relief!
Maybe Tom should quit before he hurts himself.
What time is it?
Did you hear that sound?
"This book is written in simple English, so it's easy to read."
It's not something anyone can do.
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
I understand what you mean.
It was difficult to remove the coffee stain.
The kidnappers tied Tom's hands behind his back.
Is she a doctor?
Tom is very special.
"Instead of going to Europe, I decided to go to America."
Once again.
We immediately became friends.
What did he say?
"Englishmen are, on the whole, conservative."
I remember locking the door.
Someone finally called 911.
I looked all over the house for that letter.
Tom is from Boston.
I will make her happy.
All you can do is wait.
We can hide in here.
"No, thank you."
Tom is in his room sleeping.
"When in Rome, do as the Romans do."
He arrived with a pretty girl on his arm.
I think otherwise.
Tom is living with his uncle now.
I'll miss you.
Why did you disobey my order?
This is an abomination.
"Speak louder, please."
At first he had trouble adjusting to living in his new house.
I didn't steal the money.
I don't like this city at all.
She looks as if she were drunk.
Tom tried to avoid looking at Mary.
We're eating apples.
I knew it was you.
Oil floats on water.
Here comes the train.
They're happy.
She turned down his proposal.
Stop teasing your sister!
Where will we go?
Tell me the truth.
Our company makes use of the Internet.
I will stay here all this month.
Tell us more.
I love him more than any of the other boys.
"Could you get me a glass of water, please?"
"You like rain, don't you?"
You are better than me.
The Internet is very useful for knowing the circumstances of each part of the world.
What do you suggest that we do now?
Do you like eating fish?
Why do you know that?
Will you be home for dinner?
I want to know why you did that.
Why don't you do that by yourself?
He suddenly came out with the truth.
Shut all the doors and windows.
I no longer love him.
He was laid off until there was more work to do.
Tom isn't a student here. He's one of the teachers.
How can I help?
I didn't want anybody to know where I was.
"Everyone went there, didn't they?"
He talks too much.
"Every time I use my microwave oven, my Wi-Fi stops working. It's extremely irritating."
We love our children.
Tom isn't strict enough with his students.
I like tennis very much.
I did that without consulting anyone.
The cake is still in the oven.
I know he is busy.
I'm getting off at the next station.
Wait a minute.
She finally found her missing keys.
I was wondering when you'd be back.
I love carrots.
It is a very popular destination for tourists.
He will often forget his promise.
I won't harm you.
Come to my house.
Tom told Mary that she shouldn't go there alone.
My father has lived in Nagoya for more than fifteen years.
He will always be with you.
The city was destroyed by fire.
What did you do today?
Why didn't you call me earlier?
You should give up drinking and smoking.
Do it now.
There are lots of animals in the park.
It was like Christmas morning.
I was nearly hit by a car.
How did you reply?
I'd like you to help Tom.
I have more important things to do.
I tore the newspaper into pieces.
He is eating.
Tom pretended he didn't see Mary.
Don't ask me for money.
Stand at ease!
This rose is beautiful.
I'm looking forward to seeing you in your wedding dress.
He's in a bad state.
I give you my word.
Run as fast as possible.
She ate only lean meat.
Don't talk like that.
I've promised Tom that I'd be there.
I know who it is you're looking for.
I don't have time.
There isn't any soap.
Close the window before going to bed.
Japan and South Korea are neighbors.
The murder remains a mystery.
I didn't know he drank so much.
Have you spoken to Tom?
He's at home right now.
I want to learn how to say this word in Arabic.
I want more.
She loves Tom.
I will have been studying English for five years next February.
It was very weird.
I've seen Tom here before.
I have no money on me.
Tom was the last kid to go home.
He reached for the apple.
You must learn from your mistakes.
Are you good at tennis?
I'm not likely to forget to do that.
I work for a shipping company.
We really enjoyed ourselves.
Be prepared.
Where's the whipped cream?
How old do you think she is?
You look very tired.
What kind of surgery do you need?
The popularity of websites depends on their content.
He likes watching TV.
Tom thinks the food Mary makes is usually too spicy.
Do you know who I am?
Have you ever prayed in a mosque?
Most people think so.
I really dig that singer.
Three bodies were found in the cave.
Don't move.
I have to go to the hospital.
I would like to see it.
Who drew it?
We've arrived.
I went to drink a beer with friends.
What do you want to talk about?
Let's get out of here before Tom sees us.
Did you see the shooter's face?
We took turns driving.
It's lunch time.
What's your name?
"He will go to Tokyo tomorrow, won't he?"
We must contact the police at once.
I've baked a cake for Tom.
You didn't understand.
I'm going to find a place of my own.
Then what?
I told you I don't know how to do that.
I waited for Tom for a long time.
"If I get rich, I will buy it."
Why don't you listen to me?
I am in the house.
I'll need some tools.
I thought you said you didn't like Tom.
That house is big.
I do not work.
I've been here before.
I am busy now.
It wasn't easy to solve this problem.
The bus leaves in five minutes.
No one I know talks to Tom anymore.
You had better stay away from work today.
She's not my sister.
Aren't you thirsty?
You haven't finished your coffee.
Tom still thinks we're friends.
What are you going to do with it?
What led you to believe so?
He asked me for help.
You're disgusting!
Here is a book.
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.
She bought eggs by the dozen.
I saw a group of tourists who spoke Turkish.
He couldn't get the job.
His daughter and my son are good friends.
I'm looking forward to summer vacation.
I'm thirsty.
Let me help you.
Don't you ever sweat?
Good evening.
He was traveling in the Philippines this time last year.
I heard various opinions.
He thinks I love her.
California is famous for its fruit.
I love challenges.
This water is delicious.
Your house is three times as large as mine.
Did you miss me?
There were twenty or so people there.
I just finished the work.
Is there something you want to buy?
Tom is my hostage.
What are you doing?
Better late than never.
Waking up is the opposite of going to sleep.
I had no difficulty finding your house.
"Could I have one more coffee, please?"
I didn't want to spend any more time trying to convince Tom to study French.
You can take either book.
This dictionary is better than that one.
How did you know that?
I need you.
Do I have to do it right away?
They hated Tom.
He has a car.
I'm not tired.
He raised his hand.
Please delete this file.
This is one of Tom's favorite books.
I have many photos.
I'm really embarrassed.
The conference will end tomorrow.
They forced her to confess.
Is this your umbrella?
Are you happy with that?
No one lives here anymore.
We've just finished breakfast.
Did you go to Cairo or Alexandria?
He was killed with a sword.
Forgive me for being late.
Tom has his father's eyes.
I wanted to buy a painting from Tom.
I'm looking for a book about medieval Spain.
My dog is afraid of water.
Can you recommend a good doctor?
She smiled and accepted my little present.
Don't forget our date tomorrow.
This is the right answer.
I hope Tom is more careful next time.
I think that'll happen.
This knife is very sharp.
I can't live without a TV.
That is a table.
He lives in Tokyo.
Tom isn't so tall.
Eat your veggies.
She's correct for sure.
I must help him.
Do you think Tom bought it?
I also went there.
"When will you be back? ""It all depends on the weather."""
My hair isn't as long as Tom's.
There is no reason why I shouldn't do it.
I'll take this umbrella.
"In my opinion, horses are very intelligent animals."
Don't forget to tip the waiter.
It was where you told me it would be.
Why should we need more money?
How many schools are there in your city?
I never wanted you to get involved in this mess.
Calm down.
We haven't received any help from anyone.
I can peel an apple.
"What are you doing, Dad?"
She advised him not to use too much sugar.
She always keeps her room clean.
These are my brothers.
What do you want?
I will go there even if it rains.
I've learned a lot.
They haven't come back home yet.
I don't know why.
I'm not trying to deprive you of your rights.
Make me happy.
"May I come in? ""Yes, certainly."""
Tom can't let go of the past.
"I'm fine, thank you."
Why did you quit your job?
You must pay in advance.
The students learned this poem by heart.
You have to stop.
My dad is very strict.
There is no sign of life on Mars.
Can I borrow your scissors?
Where are they?
They should have known better.
Don't worry. Didn't I say that everything would go well?
Can you prove it?
I am only joking.
I go every year.
I don't understand music.
They're suffering from malaria.
He reads a good deal.
It makes me so happy.
He has been waiting for an hour.
Where is the school?
I plan to invite a lot of guests to the opening ceremony.
The others will arrive in a few minutes.
I work every day except Sunday.
"You are tired, aren't you?"
We don't need your help.
My grandfather gets up early.
We have no options but to continue.
Why me?
Friends should help one another.
They're happy.
"Out of my way, boy."
I need to charge my cell phone.
Your hair's beautiful.
It's going to be quite hot today.
Tom likes you.
What's happening?
Control yourself.
This is where he lives.
That's a hard question to answer.
Take his car keys.
I doubt I'll finish this today.
What's happening here?
He's talking on the telephone.
This isn't drinking water.
It was a mistake to refuse his assistance.
The cargo ship arrived four hours early.
I took that picture a week ago.
Does Tom have a daughter named Mary?
I'll pay for lunch.
You must keep your room clean.
You should go see a doctor.
She was promoted.
Where's your money?
I saw a bird flying over a tree.
Check everyone.
I love you.
Let's hope it works.
I think we can help each other.
He's not breaking the law.
Nothing is achieved without effort.
Is this love?
This doll is a gift from my aunt.
It's a quote from a book.
He struck a match.
Don't you play tennis?
Would you pass me the salt?
We all desire success.
He kept a seat for me.
I'm unsure.
"Tom waited a long time for Mary, but she never showed up."
They are struggling for freedom.
Can you drive a car?
I caused him a lot of trouble.
Add up these figures.
Where is the bank?
"Hey, what are you looking at?"
It won't be easy to forget you.
Wash your feet.
Turn down the radio.
He did his best to rescue her.
She can count from one to ten.
I have the ace of clubs.
Are you talking to me?
I don't know this game.
Your glasses fell on the floor.
He left the door open.
That boy is running.
I wrote a song about you.
I have heard the story.
This is an automatic door.
They agreed to elect him as president.
I think this table takes up too much space.
What did you answer?
Clean the dirt off the mirror.
I'm an honest person.
Would you like me to call a taxi?
Are you sad?
That kind of person will fail for sure.
I didn't see you at my cocktail party last weekend.
I believe in God.
You have nothing to fear.
I like her younger sister very much.
Let's forget about the past.
We found her alive.
Let's get drunk.
It's not my fault.
She loves Tom.
"There are no shortcuts to the top, only to the bottom."
"If I were to tell you the truth, you would be surprised."
How will he pay his debts?
I owe my success to my friend.
Tom took his camera with him.
Tom's explanation was very confusing.
Why is this happening again?
Where is the book?
Let's get ready to go.
Why don't we just agree to disagree?
You are not Japanese.
Tom almost forgot the conference.
The rainy weather lasted for ten days straight.
Tom lost his sense of smell.
What do you think?
He stayed awake all night wondering why the deal went wrong.
The police accused him of murder.
Are you by yourself or with someone?
I won't forget that day.
Is there anything else you want to tell me?
I'm sure Tom would never do something like that.
A rabbit has long ears.
I want to go to Australia one more time before my passport expires.
Let me take your blood pressure.
My goal in life is to be a novelist.
We have to expect the worst.
I know I'm wrong.
This is what I found in the cave.
Welcome home.
I'm about to leave.
Hurry!
I think Tom knows why.
The rumor isn't true.
This tattoo is stupid.
She is very intelligent.
Where's the map?
He does not smoke.
Tom complained that he couldn't find a job.
How I've missed you!
Thank you for your kindness.
Next spring I want to graduate.
What did you want to do?
Destiny is sometimes cruel.
Won't you join our conversation?
How is everyone?
The workers are exhausted.
Is this book yours?
She despised him.
Come on. You can do it.
I don't come here very often.
I want something to read.
You can't swim here.
I would like to hear your opinion.
The water is warm.
The peace talks failed once again.
We helped one another.
The rear-view mirror fell off.
I was very thirsty and I wanted to drink something cold.
My aunt has been dead for two years.
I'd like to sing you a song.
She slapped his face.
Do you know how to use a computer?
"Obviously, he is to blame."
All you have to do is tell Tom to leave.
War broke out in 1939.
It was very kind of you to lend me an umbrella.
I will not blame him for the accident.
We must do away with violence.
We aren't going to lose.
Everyone knows.
The rain changed into snow.
This is such an easy problem that any student can solve it.
The first stage is complete.
That's a brilliant idea.
Will you drive me home?
He often drives his father's car.
Tom wanted you to know.
Bring help.
Please fill out this form first.
Tom saved her from the fire.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Tom hasn't been indicted.
Take care.
She used to work for our company.
Every house had a garden.
He is preparing for the test.
Tom asked Mary if she would help him.
My brother is an idiot.
"Like father, like son."
Be quiet during the lesson.
Take her to the OR.
You look like a boy.
I like your offer.
I'll make you happy.
I'm only joking.
She helped the old man cross the road.
She's anxious to know the results.
The ground seems wet.
Can you tell me how to get to Lincoln Center?
I spent all afternoon in the library.
I have questions.
Why couldn't you come yesterday?
What about Tom?
Try it and tell me what it tastes like.
The game was suspended.
She was at the crime scene.
It's getting warmer and warmer.
You can go to the station by bus.
"He noticed a hole in his jacket, but he tried to ignore it."
"If I knew the truth, I would tell you."
Where do you intend to spend your vacation?
A hundred and fifty diplomats came to that conference.
"One day, you will understand."
I don't have a girlfriend.
We don't know how or why.
Where's the exit?
You have better sight than me.
I like your work.
I was laughed at by everyone.
None of my friends drink coffee.
Have we met before?
I am hoping to get two copies of this book.
Is it true that you weren't here yesterday?
Can I take this with me?
I'm nothing without you.
I prefer biking.
Don't avoid my question.
Please turn off the television.
Its color is red.
You were supposed to tell Tom that.
He was very patient.
"Yes, of course."
"Trust me, he said."
She answered in tears.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
I want to sleep.
I'm waiting for your reply.
Would you like to dance with me?
I thought you might want to come along.
We should have been more careful.
Stop teasing your brother!
No one knows where that dog came from.
I want my mommy.
Don't stand near me.
Do you know where Tom hid?
She turned down my request.
She should listen more to other people.
This is her house.
I don't understand it.
Don't resort to violence.
That's the biggest strawberry I've ever seen.
I'd like to know the reason why.
"Hey, listen to this."
She needs him more than he needs her.
I'll tell you what I want you to do.
What happened here?
Yesterday was Thursday.
I like coffee better than tea.
I don't know anything yet.
She got good grades in English.
Are you all ready?
Look at that!
Why don't you and I do that together?
He knows the city well.
I want to read that book.
I don't want to have anything to do with you.
We're out of sugar.
I am going to play tennis tomorrow.
"Show me a cheaper one, please."
You will see the difference.
Where is the station?
May I see the telephone directory?
"I'm just looking, thank you."
We must cancel our trip to Japan.
I love trying to do new things.
I received her letter yesterday.
Shouldn't you go home?
She is absent because of sickness.
He drinks a glass of water every morning.
I'll get the money from Tom one way or another.
Were you there before?
That's what I loved about Tom.
This is really interesting.
Bring food.
Say it in English.
She took her own life.
Don't give up. You still have a chance.
"All right, I'll do it."
Does this remind you of anybody?
That wasn't what I wanted to hear.
He tried it over and over again.
It rained throughout the night.
This drawing dates back to the fifteenth century.
Are you free tomorrow?
There's no reason Tom would say something like that.
I can't wait to meet you.
Please send it to me by fax.
A known mistake is better than an unknown truth.
Why is Tom not here?
Learn these names by heart.
It's pretty weird.
How strange life is!
Forget it.
Tom is very interested in jazz.
I don't know where this came from.
I went to Europe once.
I went to a commercial high school.
Do you play soccer?
The rain lasted four days.
"Without your advice, I would have failed."
She likes to run.
"Whether he comes or not, I'll go."
Stay thin.
I'm taking a couple of days off.
He will play tennis with his friends.
Is there anyone else you want to talk to?
I'm a little tired.
"As soon as I finish writing the report, I'll send it to you."
I can do everything myself.
What a beautiful garden!
A survey shows that many businessmen skip lunch.
Tom has immunity.
Thanks for your explanation.
You can say whatever you want to.
The horse stopped and wouldn't move.
Tom dipped a strawberry in chocolate and then put it in his mouth.
Don't worry. Didn't I say that everything would go well?
Don't forget to add a little salt.
"When I hear this song, I think of you, and miss you."
We're going to eat a lot tonight so I hope you're not on a diet.
They had a dent in the rear door.
They aren't farmers.
Bring wine.
He employs a maid.
She has five older brothers.
Did you hear the news on the radio?
Where are you from?
Trees are planted along the street.
You are as tall as I am.
Your friend is here.
Let's ask her when she gets back home.
Do you remember the town where he was born?
Let's go to my office.
I'm sorry I don't have my watch with me.
Never underestimate Tom.
What should I do?
Sales are down now.
You should start as early as you can.
The air conditioner doesn't work.
I ran for a mile.
No one knows his name.
I had my car stolen last night.
Are you going to pay a visit to China this fall?
Please have someone else do it.
What do you think now?
I've changed my daily routine.
What time does the movie start?
This is a story about Tom.
Her mother is writing a letter.
I don't like swimming in salt water.
I think that's what happened.
We have a chance.
They are still children.
We're looking for someone who can take care of these kinds of problems.

You will succeed some day.
Everyone dies.

Wonderful!

Do you know how to get to Tom's house?
That bus will take you to the zoo.
I was happy yesterday.
"I cook, but I don't do that with much pleasure."
The list is endless.
Let's synchronize our watches.
You should turn off the light before going to sleep.
I'm not trying to deprive you of your rights.
"Oh my God, I can't believe this."
I'm very proud of my father.
Do you believe in the existence of ghosts?
I was in London most of the summer.
How long did you wait for me?
I thought you'd found someone else.
Why are you in such a hurry?
I've never seen anything like that.
She asked him why he was crying.
I was only there for three days.
Do you study English?
Who do you think you are?

It was love at first sight.
Contact Tom.
He's eating an apple.
Whatever you say.
We're out of sugar.

No problem at all!
What's the width of this road?
Her only hobby is collecting stamps.

Parents need to encourage their children to read.
Sometimes you scare me.

Those who know him like him.
"When I got home, I found I had lost my wallet."
Any student can solve this problem.
There is a basket under the table.
Tom isn't as tolerant as I am.
The man spoke in a low voice.
I don't have any evidence.
What would you do if you were ten years younger?
"He who asks is a fool for five minutes, but he who does not ask remains a fool forever."
Tom often complains about his mother's cooking.
Don't talk like that.
The door opened automatically.
Are you coming?

Don't play here.
Just tell me what you want.
Can I use your pencil?
She likes ice cream.
What did you do yesterday evening?
This is not important.
How annoying!
We could see the sunset from the window.
You must be more polite.
"Tom wanted to take me to a dance, but I said no."
I have to go the bathroom.
"At times, I can't trust him."
I can't explain it either.
She kept on working.
The noise was quite loud.
Tom is your brother.
She sang better than him.
May I go to the river?
I will read a book.

What time is it?
"Yes, I know."
"At the tone it will be one hour, fifty eight minutes and forty seconds."
Good luck.
Show me another example.
I called him up yesterday.
Tom works in a hospital.
I was absent.
My brother has become a priest.
I congratulate you on your success.
Tom and Mary both laughed.
"Well, let's go."
He did well in the examination.
She's as clever as they make 'em.
Where does your uncle live?
Stop hitting your brother.
I knew he would accept.
You still have a chance.
That won't help you.
It's for tourists.
This is your book.
Let's meet again soon.
"Can somebody help me? ""I will."""
He ordered us steaks.
Tom tried to kill me.
I'm sure of his success.

That old woman lives by herself.
I don't know whether he'll come by train or by car.

All roads lead to Rome.
He's smart.
I know why you don't want to do that.
How many apples are there?
I don't watch TV very much.
I am not sure whether I will be able to come with you.
She is loved by everyone.
Are you with Tom?
I'm trying to understand why you didn't do it.
The nurse gave me a shot.
Tom lied.
Can you give me a lift to the station?
I'm very happy to know you.
May I use your telephone?
My grandfather is in his nineties.
He must be over sixty.
Please keep this secret.
My shoes are bigger than yours.
I'm happy with that.
Many tourists visit Kyoto in the spring.
Give me the book.
I went to the zoo yesterday.
He is more lucky than clever.
You can put it anywhere.
January is the first month of the year.
I don't remember asking for your opinion.
Travel broadens one's horizons.

I am new here.
Whales feed on small fish.
There are sixty seconds in a minute.
I don't want to hear another word about it!
He became a pianist.
You must go.

I'll drive you home.
She devoted her life to music.
How did you sleep last night?
You can't buy happiness.
Listen to me.
I want to be here.
Who painted these pictures?
Tom always has a smile on his face.
I'll eat it here.
There is not enough demand for this product.
It's been raining since last night.
I'm in my car.
Could you tackle this?
I needed to make sure you'd come here.
We succeeded!
Take all the time you need.
I know your father.
Tom loves going out.
I can see what you mean.
Tom climbed up the ladder to the roof of the garage.
Mastering a foreign language isn't easy.
Place it wherever you like.
I'm undressing.
He put salt into his cup of coffee by mistake.
Any book will do.
The stock market has dropped today.
This dog is white.
I'm afraid the doctor is out.
I'm not worried about it.
Here comes the bus!
I was supposed to tell Tom where to go.
The waves are high.
I don't know what's worse: being stupid or pretending to be stupid.
She put the magazine on the table.
Check again.
Read the bottom of the page.
Please get out of the car.
Tom never thinks about others.
She showed me around the campus.
You people go ahead. We'll bring up the rear.
This happened a long time ago.
Cool it down.
What did Tom need?
They all drank.
He showed it to me.
I don't have any money.
Tom is better at French than you might think.
The police are after me.
This book is about a king who loses his crown.

I believe what you said is true.
You should keep your desk clean.
How did you know what she wanted?
I can't remember his name.
"By signing the contract, I committed myself to working there for another five years."
Tom was Mary's first love.
Can you speak French?
"Easy come, easy go."
Nearly a thousand people participated in the demonstration.
I saw one once.
"Now that I am here, you don't have to worry."
I don't have an excuse.
Let Tom go.
What were you doing?
I'm in trouble.
Learning a foreign language is difficult.
You are responsible for what you do.
She divided the cake into six pieces.
Did you behave today?
The force of the wind made it difficult to walk.
I hope you aren't too disappointed.
I think Tom likes me.
I found him a job.
No one knows his real name.
"I'll take that one, too."
"When I was a child, I would spend hours reading alone in my room."
People make mistakes.
It's a good deal.
Please add my name to the list.
You broke the rules.
That hotel was very near the lake.
Tom loves to travel.
Local shops do good business with tourists.
He is a beginner.
Of course.
He is not available.
I returned his book to him.
I'll be there till 2:30.
When do we arrive?
I want my dinner brought to my room.
Truer words have never been spoken.
They are very big.
I would go to the library if I had a car to get there.
"If I were rich, I'd give you money."
We know our rights.
Come here at once.
I can't allow you to do that.

Where are they?
What should I bring?
I can do it by myself.
She divorced her husband.
What a beautiful garden!
I can't thank you enough.

Not all birds can fly.
Tom told me Mary is in jail.
This is a terrible thing.
She bought two pounds of butter.
I have your diary.
Please give me a cup of tea.
May I say something?
"Which one do you prefer, this one or that one?"
You're not going to like what I'm going to say.
The boss gave us all a day off.
My father has never been abroad.
He is not a smoker.
I met her on my way to school.
We don't know her.
See you again.
What's the matter?
It's not rocket science.
Don't worry about us.
Nearly a thousand people participated in the demonstration.
Take care of the kids.
The world has become a dangerous place for tourists.
Cats are very clean animals.
"Well, see you later."
Don't look back.
The bananas you brought to me last night were all bad.
I rarely eat meat.
All my friends can speak French.
What're you looking at?
I'm going to help you save some time.
These are my books.
I know him by his first name.
When shall we have the party?
You shouldn't judge others on how they look.
You can't afford to neglect your health.
That doesn't even make sense.
Why are you so tired today?
I think you're wasting your time.
It's on the table.
How should I know?
Let's try something.
I slept on the ground.
Tom can't see Mary from where he is.
May I ask a couple of questions?
She began crying.
Mary took the cookies out of the oven.
I got thirsty.
Place it wherever you like.
You never listen. I might as well talk to the wall.
The driver accelerated his car.
I don't want it anymore.
She is a singer.
That's your responsibility.
I've got a pacemaker.
Sit down with me.
What time do you get up?
I'll get the food.
When did you arrive?
Don't forget that there are exceptions.
I left the rest to him and went out.
Someone will close the window.
Please sit down.
May I help you?
You make me happy.
I like sports.
I like them both.
The storm caused a lot of damage.
My new job leaves me little time to socialize.
He kissed her.
The door opened.
I built an amplifier yesterday.
Hands off.
Tom is losing blood.
Here is your bag.
What a lucky person he is!
Now I remember.
The new plan has been very successful.
You must face the facts.
We'll have to postpone the meeting.
I must go now.
Let's not watch TV.
The enemy kept up the attack all night.
I have a friend in England.
I was laughed at by him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I did see him.
Tom didn't read any of the messages Mary sent to him.
Who owns this house?
I'll give you a good piece of advice.
You must control yourself.
When do you study?
Who made this plan?
Don't treat me as if I were a child.
We have a guest.
Perhaps she will come tomorrow.
I'm feeling fit.
I bought a new computer last month.
It's only when I can't sleep at night that the ticking of the clock bothers me.
I brush my teeth twice a day.

Did I win?
Look at my new car.
Come sit with us.
She's my older sister.
What do you think you're doing?
I went for a walk in the park.
Do you see the raccoon?
Do you really think that Tom won't come?
"Make way, please."
It was cold yesterday.
Let's meet here again tomorrow.
Japan is an industrial country.
My parents live in the country.
I prefer to work on my own.
He did what he had been told.
He broke into a house.
When do I get my turn?
"Tom always wears a tie to work, except on Fridays."
It was raining so hard that we decided to stay home.
I would rather sing than dance.
What do you wish for?
English is a global language.
Everybody laughed.
He is angry with you.
I need your help.
The water is clean.
He went to the shop.
He shut the door.
It's bedtime.
He got thrown out of the house.
I can't trust people like him.
Have you ever played baseball?
Come swim with me.
War broke out in 1941.
The old man is very kind.
It's very nice of you.
I love to dance.
Tell me where to put these books.
My house is close to a bus stop.
Tom understands the risks.
I would like to see your products.
You really don't want to know.
Come down for a minute.
Tom looks horrible.
Don't give up if you fail.
I remember giving him the key.
Keep children away from medicine.
I wish you had more time for me.

A bear can climb a tree.
Who wrote this book?
Her father left her the house in his will.
The driver accelerated his car.
He's stupid and dishonest.
What did you forget?
I really trust his ability.
Maybe he will be a good teacher.
I can't think of a suitable example.
We don't have any food.
Do you remember?
"You are tall, but he is still taller."
I don't remember exactly where I put the keys.
We require your help.
What are you punishing them for?
School begins at half past eight.
There's something I want to show you.
Could we have a fork?
His new book is going to come out next month.
"Tom had something important to say, but Mary kept interrupting him."
"Bring me a cup of coffee, will you?"
Are you Japanese?
I was waiting for that question.
I will transfer the money.
You haven't changed at all.
Let's watch TV.
Listen to your father.
What do you mean?
Japan is confronted with severe economic problems.
Good morning. We have good weather today.
How much is that mountain bike?
Call me as soon as you find Tom.
This summer resort is no longer as popular as it used to be.
One plus two equals three.
My favorite dance is the tango.
That's a good plan.
That castle is beautiful.
Tom was scolded by his boss for showing up late for work.
Do you have your driver's license?
I wasn't aware that Tom should do that.
I'm sorry.
We're against war.
I always wondered what was in your attic.
Do you love each other very much?
I know your name.
He's behaving oddly.
My uncle has completely recovered from his illness.
We are all suspicious about him.
She was busy with the housework.
Her daughter has become a beautiful woman.
I intend to clean my room.
"As a matter of fact, I haven't eaten anything since this morning."
They're going to have a lot more questions than we do.
Don't touch me with your soapy hands.
"If it had not been for your help, my father would have failed."
Let us know if you don't understand something.
Don't touch me!
I was nearly run over by a truck.
Tom and Mary exchanged smiles.
Birds fly.
She lives in New York.
I took that photo a week ago.
You may choose whichever you want.
Everything was fine until Tom started drinking.
My heart was filled with happiness.
I'm old enough.
They move from place to place.
"At last, he came."
We're very sorry.
She is absent because of sickness.
What is your address?
The boy ran away.
I have to stay in bed all day.
Time seemed to stop.
You should listen to what Tom says.
I heard an unusual noise.
What time does your plane leave?
Do whatever's required.
I quickly ate lunch.
Why is he here?
She sat next to me.
He disclosed his intentions.
Why is taking pictures of trains so interesting?
It's not broken.
I pointed at him.
Let's play tennis after school.
This is ours.
Come back right now.
Don't forget that.
You're either with us or you're against us.
I worked for a full 24 hours without getting any sleep.
I don't want you to worry about me.
He can't run very fast.
These books are new.
He has started to write a novel.
She asked me where I was going.
Tom went to Boston with a friend.
Tom turned the lights off.
Tom isn't here.
We're facing a violent crisis.
I bought her a clock.
I love her and she loves me.
We were late because of the storm.
Barking dogs seldom bite.
What made you change your mind?
I'm going to play chess with Tom today.
What are you up to tomorrow afternoon?
Maybe what you said is true.
The rioters beat many policemen to death.
Tom had to make a decision.
I met him yesterday.
"The card you drew was a red, wasn't it?"
Make it smaller.
This is the very CD I've been looking for.
Tom has money.
Where was he born?
I don't see anything wrong with what you're doing.
Let's check with an expert.
This will take time.
There's no need to hurry. We have plenty of time.
You're exaggerating the problem.
How are you?
He has no girlfriend.
Tom will escape.
Love is immortal.
I wasn't sure what was going on.
I have a sister.
He is a famous artist.
"It's not a convenient time to speak about that, is it?"
I have the feeling that I've met that guy before.
A hungry man is an angry man.
The president is expected to put forward a new energy policy.

He works in the lab.
I've never met him.
How about going to a movie?
I've had a pleasant evening.
Where were you?
Tom bought a pair of leather motorcycle gloves.
The gang was planning a robbery.
There's no mistake.
Where was the mistake?
We sat in the center of the room.
I'm getting off the train at the next stop.
Why do you want to know that?
You may borrow this book as long as you keep it clean.
Let's not be in too much of a hurry.
You must help your mother.
I'm sorry to have caused you such inconvenience.
It's nearly three o'clock.
I'll admit I'm wrong.
I need a pencil.
I'll leave the decision to you.
Who are you?
We rose from our seats when the national anthem was played.
How lucky you are!
What you did was wrong.
Come here.
Keep your eyes open.
Where can I pick up my ticket?
She turned around and smiled.
I'll never forget this incident.
Are you sure you're feeling OK?
I think Tom can't understand French.
Mathematics is my favorite subject.
This medicine will relieve your headache.
Tom doesn't know how to milk a goat.
Check around.
I'm going to go take a shower.
Where did you go?
Are you the person in charge?
It was a lovely autumn evening.
People sometimes compare death to sleep.
"Generally speaking, savings are increasing."
Hurry!
What turned her against you?
Will you help me with my English homework?
The water was warm.
"Water freezes at zero degrees Celsius, doesn't it?"
A boy like Tom doesn't deserve a girl like Mary.
I go shopping every morning.
I don't have the address with me.
Let's help each other.
Don't get run over.
I'm too scared to go there by myself.
I have to go to bed.
This is a list of what we need.
He is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
Why can't I have my own room?
I think he is angry.
Do you have an address?
We're not getting anywhere.
I'll try to shape my ideas into a book.
Thank you for your interest.
Do you have any idea who would do this kind of thing?
Where was Tom born?
I'll see you tomorrow.
