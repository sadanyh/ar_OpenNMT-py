Muslims believe there is only one God.
The police officer fired a warning shot.
It's too dangerous for you to stay here.
Definitely!
The flame went out.
He speaks English fluently.
They are my brothers.
He's her friend.
I'm not sure what Tom was talking about.
Tom doesn't usually show his feelings.
"Yes, I know it."
Does it look OK?
Everyone wants to meet you. You're famous!
Forget it.
I want to go with you.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Tom told me not to go into the cave.
Even Homer sometimes nods.
It was probably not true.
Police are investigating Tom.
My father made a shelf for me.
Everybody loves her.
They believed he was honest.
These windows are bulletproof.
"If this problem weren't serious, Tom wouldn't be here."
"Ten minutes after the knockout, the boxer regained consciousness."
My aim is to be a doctor.
"Even though he was poor, he was happy."
He pretended that he was a lawyer.
They don't even know why.
"Everything I did, I did for Tom."
My sister made me a beautiful doll.
Tom will help me clean my room.
You'll learn how to do it sooner or later.
May I ask where are you going?
I'm a student.
When is the party?
I'd like to see her.
Mary came in.
I don't know him.
I have a daughter who's married to a Frenchman.
See you tomorrow.
I'm pleased to meet you.
An old lady sang to me.
"You want a divorce, don't you?"
I was happy then.
I'm a man.
Was that too much?
"Now that I'm retired, I can travel as much as I want to."
"Thanks to your help, I could succeed."
Tom and Mary exchanged smiles.
Muslims believe that Jesus was one of God's messengers.

Did you sleep here last night?
I saw you outside.
The crown prince is the one who is to succeed to the throne.
He found my bike.
Tom is immune to that disease.
Don't worry about me.
He was covered in mud from head to foot.
We only have tea.
I don't eat fruit.
We arrived at the office on time.
Is that black bag yours?
I love her.
This is an extremely important point.
Leave me alone!
I'll drive you to the airport.
Tell Tom to pick up the phone.
I prefer mineral water.
Why didn't you tell us you knew French?
This wall is painted green.
What's your real purpose?
The three countries were united to make one country.
This bird cannot fly.
Be specific.
Why does this always happen to me?
Don't move till I get back.
I did not understand him at all.
I haven't yet graduated.
Come on. Let's get out of here.
My life has changed quite a lot.
All I know is that he came from China.
I don't know.
I don't know how to handle children.
Would you tell me what's going on here?
I'd rather be a bird than a fish.
I like reading books.
It seems to me that you are honest.
The earth rotates.
My mom doesn't speak English very well.
Don't you want to stop Tom?
It is a difficult problem.
"If it smells funny, don't eat it."
I'll never do it again.
Tom turned the lights off.
That's happened to me before.
Do you remember the day when you and I first met?
The purpose of our trip is to visit friends and see some tourist spots.
He is anxious to go with you.
I don't regret coming here.
Please tell me about your trip.
Her speech moved the audience.
Many thanks.
There are no problems.
I'm free now.
It's useless to try and resist.
That would've been fun.
I called my dog.
She'll do it in 24 hours.
I ordered a book from London.
This story is based on a true story.
This movie is worth seeing again.
You run into Japanese tourists everywhere.
Why are you going?
Tom was sitting at a nearby table.
You might want to talk to Tom.
Tom is better than us.
This is not the entrance.
They followed you.
I'll pay.
I have no time to do my homework.
Please correct my pronunciation.
I'll lend you my notebook.
Tomorrow is my first day of work.
Mathematics is an interesting subject.
Tom pretended that he didn't see Mary.
Nobody can understand him.
"A good password should be difficult to guess, but easy to remember."
I'm doing great.
What time do you usually go to bed?
I'm not satisfied with what you've done.
I want to spend more time alone with you.
Is there an elevator?
How did you cook this?
The truth is I've never even met Tom.
He hurt his left foot when he fell.
I knew you'd come.
I admit that I was wrong.
I'm not going to school on Saturday.
Your gums are in bad shape.
I cannot give you a definite answer today.
You'd better go to see your family doctor at once.
I can do it all myself.
Our school burned down.
He has left us.
Take a look.
I haven't been fishing in a long time.
"If I were you, I would also do the same."
What can I do?
I want to forget her.
I'm not interested in doing that.
Tom loved skiing.
Sport is good for your health.
My father is in good health.
You should go.
A boy like Tom doesn't deserve a girl like Mary.
Come on!
My father gave me a new fountain pen.
How often do you go abroad?
That's too much.
My orders are absolute.
Who are those girls?
Is your watch correct?
Thanks for the advice.
Have you done all your homework?
He played tennis yesterday.
It doesn't matter.
He gives her everything she asks for.
His car turned over several times before falling into the river.
"I may be old, but I can still ride a bike."
Why don't you like me?
Whoever committed this crime was surely out of his mind.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
Do you believe ghosts exist?
Is this your car?
That's a terrific idea.
Do you have an appointment?
He was hit by a car and died right away.
Let me help you with your work.
I just arrived now.
I don't like you anymore.
Stay away.
"Had I arrived earlier, I could have seen Kelly."
Let's eat sushi.
She kept on working.
Tom looks very busy today.
He is always late for school.
Do you remember the night when we first met?
Your necktie matches your suit.
She finished reading the letter.
I read at least one book every month.
"Watch your mouth, Tom."
The door is locked.
Maybe you can tell me where I can find Tom.
Don't worry about it!
She is unconscious.
My hobby is making model planes.
She accused me of being a liar.
You ought to be ashamed.
Don't do it!
You must clean your room.
It's ready now.
My mother has been taking French lessons for several years.
"Walk faster, or you'll miss the train."
I didn't know Tom had to do that by himself.
I miss him.
You are mistaken about that.
"No matter what you do, you have to do your best."
Are you meeting someone here?
I'm happy to see you.
Tom lives in an old building.
Whose pen is this?
Where's the closest train station?
I'm not sure if this is correct.
You need to study more.
Wake up!
Who is your teacher?
He declined my proposal.
She trembled with fear.
The dispute was finally settled.
Why are you doing this?
See you then.
A lot of tourists come here.
War suddenly broke out.
How nice of you!
Isn't it black?
This book is new.
He can come.
Don't waste your time.
I'll never let you do that again.
What's your occupation?
They're eating apples.
How did you get to know her?
He's a very selfish person.
One failure followed another.
How many times do I need to repeat it?
I've shut all six windows.
Go brush your teeth.
What time will you leave?
She eats nothing but vegetables.
I'm busy.
French people don't think of anything as impossible.
I don't feel good about it.
"Just do the essential repairs, please."
The girl looked around.
It looks like it'll be clearing up.
You must do your best.
Our school is near the station.
The police set out to solve the crime.
She was unconscious of her mistake.
She asked me if I was all right.
I don't understand.
A caged cricket eats just as much as a free cricket.
He lost his job.
Take what you want.
You never listen. I might as well talk to the wall.
Tom's car was rear-ended and he suffered a whiplash injury.
It was an incredible job.
I came by car.
This will take a lot of time.
Tom turned the faucet off.
The tourist information center gave a city map to whoever asked it.
It may rain.
I don't believe that Tom is the killer.
We don't need your help.

I found this ring on the street this morning.
Did you break something?
What woke you up?
May I sit down?
You are the only one who can save the world.
The problem is too difficult to solve.
I am grateful to you for inviting me to the party.
The boy remained silent.
"You're forgetting something, aren't you?"
The boy is thirsty.
What would you do if you were ten years younger?
We have to get results.

I'm looking forward to your Halloween party.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
Who are you?
He was stupid enough to believe her.
What a beautiful rainbow!
I have to help my mother.
You are not in a position to ask for anything.
I met a dog on my way home.
I don't want to lose you.
There's something I forgot to say.
I gave him all the money I had.
She had suffered a heart attack.
You're exaggerating the problem.
"No matter how tired he is, he writes in his diary before going to bed."
This is where Tom usually parks his car.
Why did you lend money to someone like her?
I'm very grateful for your help.
It tastes really good.
Why is that wrong?
The sun gives us light and heat.
The sky is clear.
Will you make a list of issues to discuss?
Your shoes are here.
I've already spoken with Tom.
I'm looking forward to spending time with my family.
We have to do the shopping.
I'm bored.

We'll find one.
I wouldn't do it if I were you.
Tom's the best.
